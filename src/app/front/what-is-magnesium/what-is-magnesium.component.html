			<p class="text-dark">Magnesium is the most important major mineral that is needed by your body. In order to function correctly and efficiently, your body needs many nutrients. However, if it is deficient in magnesium, there are over 300 biochemical reactions that either will not occur at all or will occur very inefficiently. Also, magnesium is necessary for the correct assimilation of potassium and the correct and efficient functioning of enzymes, the most important of which transport, store and utilize energy. Many aspects of cell metabolism are regulated by magnesium such as DNA and RNA synthesis, cell growth and cell reproduction. Magnesium also orchestrates the electric current that sparks through the miles of nerves in our body. <br><br> As you can imagine, without magnesium your body is going to be performing at very much less than full capacity.  A deficiency in magnesium can go from slight to very severe and your body will be signaling to you that it is in trouble.As you can imagine, without magnesium your body is going to be performing at very much less than full capacity.

			<h5>Why do people take magnesium?</h5>
			<p>Experts say that many people in the U.S. aren’t eating enough foods with magnesium. Adults who consume less than the recommended
			amount of magnesium are more likely to have elevated inflammation markers. Inflammation, in turn, has been associated with
			major health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Also, low magnesium appears to be a risk factor
			for osteoporosis.</p>
			<h5>How does it works?</h5>
			<p>Magnesium is required for the proper growth and maintenance of bones. Magnesium is also required for the proper function
			of nerves, muscles, and many other parts of the body. In the stomach, magnesium helps neutralize stomach acid and moves stools
			through the intestine.</p>
			<h5>How much magnesium do you need?</h5>
			<p>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) includes the magnesium you get from both the food you eat and any supplements you
			take.</p>
